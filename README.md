The App designed is based on Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)+Data Binding architecture

I have followed guidelines from following article

https://medium.com/@husayn.hakeem/android-by-example-mvvm-data-binding-introduction-part-1-6a7a5f388bf7

I have used Room database + Live data combination as recommended on developer.android

I have taken the liberty to change UI to keep it very simple and clean.


Enhancements that are needed

 1.Unit test cases
 2.Abstraction to Reduce code redundancy
