The App designed is based on Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)+Data Binding architecture

I have followed guidelines from following articles

https://www.journaldev.com/20292/android-mvvm-design-pattern

I have used Room database + Live data combination as recommended on developer.android

I have taken the liberty to change UI to keep it very simple and clean.

I am using Android studio verson 3.3
gradle version: 3.3.0


Enhancements that are needed

 1.Unit test cases
 2.Abstraction to Reduce code redundancy
